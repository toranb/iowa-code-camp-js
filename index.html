We'll focus on unicorn-horns as they apply to C# - but many of the ideas expressed in this talk will be consisted for VB.NET.  We'll have punch and pie.  More people will come if they think we have punch and pie.", level: 100, time: "9:00 AM - 10:15 AM", room: "Room A", speaker: {name: "Sisyphus J.

Every iPhone and Android developer immediately cast out developing for said platforms and moved immediately to developing for the Python Phone.  This talk will focus on the basics of developing for Python Phone 1.0, including practical APIs and SDKs the new developer should be aware of.", level: 200, time: "9:00 AM - 10:15 AM", room: "Room C", speaker: { name: "Johannes Johnson", bio: "Johannes first learned how to program from listening to classical music.
